## Location:

Remote (US)

## Description:

We're on the lookout for a Senior Developer who can make databases sing and servers dance. In this role, you'll be like the conductor of a digital orchestra, flawlessly harmonizing the music of Oracle and SQL Server. This isn't just about knowing the notes – it's about creating a symphony.

## Requirements:

- Got a Bachelor's degree in the bag? Great! While we're big fans of learning on the job, having that formal training can give you a head start.
- We're not kidding about the coding – you'll need to have at least eight years' experience of making databases dance to your tune.
- Need you to be a relational wiz who can code and tune SQL in an Oracle or SQL Server context like it's your favorite song.
- No lone wolves here, we're all about teamwork – but that doesn't mean you can't also shine as a solo performer.
- If you're a problem-solving maestro who can spot an issue before it hits the crescendo, you might just be the one we're looking for.

## Desired Qualifications:

- Got experience making financial/acquisition systems follow your lead? Then you'll fit right in.
- Agile methodologies are our backstage passes. If you've got experience using them, you're going to love it here.
- Bonus points if you've previously made sweet music with Momentum Financials, Red Hat JBoss, and Red Hat Fuse.
- Got a repertoire of SOAP, XML, WSDL, WS-Security, and/or JSON? Even better.

## Non-Technical Competencies:

- Communication is key – we need someone who can turn tech talk into something everyone can understand.
- Can you juggle multiple tasks, shift priorities on the fly, and still meet those tight deadlines? Then you're our kind of maestro.
- As a self-starter, you don't wait for the conductor's baton – you're ready to jump in and start playing.

If you're ready to take up the baton as our Senior Developer, hit that apply button. Your symphony awaits.
