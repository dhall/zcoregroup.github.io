Are you an ETL virtuoso who can transmute data into gold, weaving intricate patterns of information across realms? Do you wield a magical touch when it comes to data warehousing, data modeling, and the ethereal dance of ETL processes? If you're ready to be part of a guild that weaves business intelligence from the very fabric of data, join us as an ETL Artisan Developer!

**Your Alchemical Journey:**
As an ETL Artisan Developer, your mission is to transmute raw data into precious insights. Your expertise extends across data warehousing, data modeling, data integration, and the mystical art of ETL processes. Migration of data is your pilgrimage, business intelligence is your grimoire, and data modeling is your potion-making.

**Sculpting Data Realms:**
But your skills know no bounds. You're the architect of data models, weaving conceptual, logical, and physical threads into a tapestry of wisdom. The schema dances under your guidance, adorned with KPIs, Facts, and Dimensions. With Informatica as your wand, you create KPIs, build business models, and establish relationships between tables that echo through the ages.

**Conjuring ETL Symphony:**
Your mastery is revealed through ETL symphonies. Using Informatica, you transform, shape, and move data from OLTP to OLAP realms. The very essence of data flows through your creations, and intricate SQL queries are your notes, composing a melody that only those attuned to data can hear.

**Necessary Talismans:**
- Your realm is a sacred triad: OBIEE 12c, BI Apps 9.6.3, Web Logic Server. In your arsenal: Informatica 9.0.1, Oracle 11.2.0.2, SQL, PL/SQL, DAC 7.8.4, TOAD, SQL* Plus, and your magic spellbook, Unix and Windows XP.
- Single-Sign On is your magic scroll â€“ you create LDAP authentication to empower user enchantments.

**Sorcery Desired:**
- Five years of ETL mastery reside within you, especially in the realm of Informatica and data warehousing.
- Your SQL scrolls have been inscribed with wisdom over a minimum of five years in Oracle relational databases.

**Guild Artisan Benefits:**
- Weave your spells into the very core of data, transforming it into precious insights.
- Collaborate with fellow artisans, crafting recommendations that enhance data modeling and ETL magic.
- Summon Informatica transformations to create a symphony of data movement that resonates through realms.

If you're prepared to unlock the secrets of data alchemy, to be the ETL Artisan Developer who crafts intelligence from raw data, heed the call and manifest your application now. The forge of data magic beckons!
