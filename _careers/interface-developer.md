## Location:

Remote (US)

## Description:

Are you ready to conduct a symphony of code? If you're a problem-solving maestro with a passion for bringing melodies to life in the form of software, then we're in search of your talent. Your stage? Oracle and SQL Server databases. Your instrument? SQL, of course. Join our ensemble of tech virtuosos and let's make beautiful code together.

## Requirements:

- Hold a BA/BS or equivalent and have danced with SQL and Oracle or SQL Server databases for at least six years. We’re not looking for someone who can merely waltz through code; we need a tango partner who can keep up with the rhythm.
- Proven experience as a soloist in the problem-solving department. Can you hit the high notes even when faced with challenging technical glitches? Perfect!
- Show off your written and oral communication skills. Can you explain the difference between Java and JavaScript to a 5-year-old? Great, you're in!
- Demonstrate an ability to efficiently juggle multiple tasks and shifting priorities. Can you keep the rhythm even when someone changes the tune? We need you.
- You are a U.S. citizen – our orchestra plays on the national stage, and you need to be a part of the band.

## Desired Qualifications:

- Track record of implementing Agile methodologies, because sometimes the tempo changes and we need to keep up.
- Technical experience with Momentum Financials and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, because variety is the spice of life.
- Development experience with Java or Python. Can you rock those strings?

## Non-Technical Competencies:

- Independence and team collaboration skills. Can you perform a solo and still blend beautifully in a chorus?
- Self-starter attitude. Are you quick to learn and put new skills to use? Awesome, you're in tune with us.
- Flexibility to put in the hours needed to meet tight deadlines. Can you play the last note right on time, every time?

If you are ready to conduct a symphony of software solutions as our Software Developer, apply now and seize the opportunity to make sweet music with us. We're eagerly waiting to see what melodies you can bring to life!
