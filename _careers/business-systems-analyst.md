## Description:

We're on the hunt for a business systems Sherlock Holmes, an analyst with a knack for problem-solving and a love for data-driven mysteries. With your trusty magnifying glass in hand (figuratively speaking), you'll deep-dive into the enigma of our financial ERP systems, becoming an expert in Momentum Financials, or perhaps even SAP or Oracle.

This isn't your regular 9-to-5, this is a data-driven quest for truth and efficiency. Your mission, if you're bold enough to accept it, is to embark on a journey through the wilds of requirements development, data analysis and validation, quality assurance/testing, and client interfacing, all in the name of troubleshooting and issue resolution.

## Requirements:

- Hold a BA/BS or equivalent degree, along with three years of relevant experience in the field of business/systems analysis. We value both the wisdom gained through experience and the insight offered by formal education.
- Have 3 years of working experience as a business/systems analyst and some familiarity with Momentum Financials or similar COTS financial ERP systems (e.g., SAP or Oracle).
- Show a remarkable talent for requirements development, data analysis and validation, and software quality assurance/testing.
- Have the ability to interface with clients to troubleshoot or research issues, even when the going gets tough.

## Desired Qualifications:

- A knack for turning complex problems into simple solutions, coupled with the tenacity to tackle even the most challenging situations.
- A love for learning new analysis and testing tools, with the ability to put these new skills to use quickly and effectively.
- Possess the unique skill to shape and mold financial ERP systems to align with organizational goals, earning you a reputation as a legend in the field.

## Non-Technical Competencies:

- Exceptional communication skills, capable of breaking down complex concepts into easy-to-understand language.
- An innate ability to stay cool under pressure, with a flexible attitude that allows you to shift priorities as needed.
- An inquisitive nature, always seeking to understand the "why" behind the "what" and a commitment to continuous learning and improvement.
- Inspirational leadership qualities that empower and motivate teams to achieve their best, fostering a collaborative and high-performing work environment.

Are you ready to take on the challenge? Then grab your detective hat and join our team of dedicated analysts. After all, it's not just about the experience you bring, but the solutions you discover on your professional journey.
