## Location: 

near Boston, MA

## Description:

Are you a lover of sleek designs and snappy interfaces? Do you go to sleep dreaming of wireframes and wake up sketching prototypes on your breakfast napkin? Do you secretly believe the Matrix could've used a better UI? Then, zCore wants to talk to you!

We're seeking a User Experience (UX) Designer who is ready to sprinkle their magic dust over our products. Your job will entail bringing in that user-centered approach to our application design development, making our products as user-friendly as a Labrador Retriever - only less furry and without the need for walkies.

## Job Responsibilities:

Support Discovery and Framing process like it’s your favorite pet
Advise on product decisions like a seasoned horoscope reader, but using user research and iterative feedback loops
Implement Lean UX principles and iterative development to define MVPs (not Most Valuable Players, although we think you are one)
Synthesize findings into actionable outcomes like an alchemist from the Middle Ages, but with data instead of lead and gold
## Skills and Experience:

Can create flow diagrams, wireframes, prototypes, and visual comps with their eyes closed (not really, please keep them open)
A master wizard with Figma, Adobe Creative Suite, Sketch, or other magical design tools
Have dabbled in the design and product development processes
Expertise in early-stage design, ideation techniques, usability testing, and other research methods
Spectacular management, communication, and presentation skills (like, TED Talk level)
Ability to play well with a team of programmers, even if they speak in binary
Has juggled customer and user feedback to create a solution as perfect as a soufflé
Familiar with agile and lean philosophies (but it's fine if you're not a philosophy major)
Able to obtain a SECRET level clearance or higher (basically, you could be a spy)
## Non-Technical Competencies:

Has communication skills so strong they could persuade a cat to take a bath
Acts professionally and respectfully, even when the coffee machine breaks down
Receives feedback like a champ, without the need for a boxing ring
Keeps a positive attitude even when facing a Monday morning
Is a true team player, able to pass the ball without causing a fumble
## Brownie Points for:

A degree in experience design, industrial design, HCI, or a related field
Experience with front-end Javascript development (you're a unicorn if you do!)
Experience using User-Centered Design (UCD) methods
Experience working in a balanced team to build, measure, and learn (like a circus acrobat)
Experience in designing/developing full-service applications
Experience working in a rapid and iterative development environment (no motion sickness)
Experience working in remote working environments (pajamas optional)
Already possesses SECRET level clearance or higher (the spy thing again)
