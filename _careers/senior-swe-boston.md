### Description: 

zCore is on a quest for a Senior Software Engineer, or as we like to say, a Code Maestro! Not your average "sit in the basement and code" gig. We need you to metaphorically juggle chainsaws as you support the Air Operations Command for the Air Force. Your primary tools will be a keyboard, an unwavering spirit, and enough caffeine to jumpstart a space shuttle.

### Key Responsibilities:

1. Dazzle us with your prowess in software design and architecture. No pressure, but we want to be amazed.
2. Keep us updated about the latest software architectures and trends. Yep, we're asking you to be our resident tech shrink.
3. Use your technical GPS to guide legacy systems to the paradise of the Cloud.
4. Break out your strategy magic tricks to quickly prototype capabilities.
5. Decipher the cryptic requirements and translate them into beautiful software designs.
6. Create reference architectures and compliance standards like you're writing the next great American novel.
7. Act as the benevolent mentor to our legion of less experienced engineers.
8. Preserve and enhance our common practices and tools. In other words, be the superhero we need.
9. Show us all the ropes of DevOps Developer Enablement.
10. Share your best practices and technical knowledge. No secret recipes here!

### Requirements:

* You're a degree-wielding genius in a highly quantitative field.
* You're trilingual in JavaScript, Java and preferably another programming language.
* You're the Sherlock Holmes of DevSecOps tools and processes.
* You tango with front-end frameworks like React or Vue like a seasoned pro.
* You're a ninja when it comes to Extreme Programming practices.
* You've got an artist's touch with software architecture and design.
* You've tamed the beasts that are Docker and Kubernetes.
* You've been the guiding light for fellow engineers.
* You have the ability to obtain a Secret clearance. James Bond style.

### Desired Qualifications:

* You've got a master's degree in a highly quantitative field. Nice.
* You've danced with backend runtimes and frameworks.
* You're a master of test authoring.
* You've been to the realm of test mocks and contract testing.
* You've earned your stripes with relevant professional certifications.
* You've got an active Secret or TS/SCI Clearance. Secret agent much?

### Non-Technical Competencies:

* You're a rockstar when it comes to communication and leadership.
* You've got a degree in respect and professionalism from the University of Life.
* You're thick-skinned and can take and give feedback like a champ.
* You're the eternal optimist, spreading positivity and constructive vibes.
* You've led teams and set priorities. Basically, you're a boss.

zCore is an equal opportunity employer. We welcome humans, aliens, and all sentient lifeforms to apply. We have coffee, endless high-fives, and a chance to create code that matters. Get on board now!
