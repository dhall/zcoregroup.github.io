## Location: 

Orlando, FL

## Description:

If you've always thought you could put a fairy godmother to shame with your organization skills and have a knack for making wishes come true, our Senior Administrative Assistant position might be the glass slipper that fits!

As Magic Carpet Operator, your days will be as diverse as a magic carpet ride! You'll produce mystical reports and enchanting program documentation, concoct sparkling graphics presentations that would put Cinderella's castle to shame, and plan and coordinate spellbinding meetings/conferences as if you were arranging a royal ball. You will also perform diligent data entry (you're probably faster than seven dwarves mining for jewels!), magical filing and reproduction of essential scrolls (a.k.a. documents).

## Requirements:

- Must have your Fairy Godmother Academy Diploma or the equivalent (High School Diploma/GED)
- Eight full rotations around the sun in the Magic Kingdom (i.e., 8 years of experience) as an administrative wizard in a fast-paced kingdom.
- Proofreading and editing skills so sharp they could compete with Mulan's swordsmanship.
- Ability to create enchanting graphic presentations as if you've been trained by the best animators.
- Your organizational skills should rival Belle's library, making even Lumiere blush with pride.
- Able to handle complex data entry tasks as quickly as Aladdin on a magic carpet race.
- A mastery of office spellcraft and wizardry including MS Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, comparable to Merlin's magical prowess.
- Familiarity with specialized and technical terminology; able to decipher ancient runes like Elsa deciphering the secrets of her ice magic.

## Desired Qualifications:

- Experience working in a fast-paced, animated environment, comparable to a day in the life of Mickey Mouse.
- Able to face challenges head-on, just like Simba stepping up to be the king of the Pride Lands.
- Capable of multitasking efficiently, like Olaf juggling his body parts while singing a musical number.
- Communication skills so excellent they could have resolved the feud between the Montagues and Capulets (or at least managed to get the Sharks and Jets to the same dance at the gym).
- Flexibility to adapt to change, just like Ariel transforming from a mermaid to a human.

If you've ever dreamed of a world where work is just as magical as an Orlando adventure, and your skills match our wish list, hop on your magic carpet and apply today!
