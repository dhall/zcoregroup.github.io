## Location: 

Orlando, FL

## Description:

Step right up! We're seeking an enchanting Senior Program Manager who's navigated the "whole new world" of healthcare not just for a "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo" moment, but for a journey as long as Snow White's slumber (that's 10 years, folks). This role isn't for greenhorns fresh off the Magic Carpet, but for a seasoned trailblazer who knows the ropes of our magical kingdom.

## Requirements:

- You've voyaged through the healthcare realms for a time span equivalent to Sleeping Beauty’s nap.
- You possess a master’s degree – you're not just Mickey Mouse, you're Professor Ludwig Von Drake.
- Your experience doesn't stop at singing "Hakuna Matata" but includes ensuring the circle of life, I mean, cycle of programs, runs as smoothly as the "It's a Small World" ride.
- If you're a holder of a Project Management Professional (PMP) certification or a similar treasure as rich as Scrooge McDuck's Money Bin, it’s like icing on the grey stuff (it's delicious, don't believe us? Ask the dishes!).
- Your experience runs as deep as the Beast’s castle dungeons, spanning the better part of a Dalmatian’s lifespan supporting a large corporation or government agency.

## Desired Qualifications:

- Being well versed in the art of guiding the magic carpet of large scale projects smoothly.
- The ability to make tough decisions just like Elsa did when she chose to let it go (spoiler alert!).
- Possessing a contagious enthusiasm that even Tigger would be jealous of.
- Managing resources as efficiently as Cinderella's Fairy Godmother, turning simple pumpkins into golden carriages.
- Most importantly, having the strength of a raging fire, mysterious as the dark side of the moon - or at least able to hum that tune with gusto.

Just like Genie was to Aladdin, you're the guiding force, the magic behind the scenes. But instead of granting three wishes, you're tasked with a more Herculean challenge: planning, initiating, managing, executing and closing out programs in the vast kingdom of our Health Care System, creating a happier ever after for all! You'll assist in the execution of targeted program goals, just as Mulan masterfully executed her mission, and bring our healthcare vision to life, no fairy dust required.

So if you think you can be our “hero on the healthcare side”, sprinkle some pixie dust on your resume and send it our way. Magic awaits!
