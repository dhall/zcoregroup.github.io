## Job Title:

Code Whisperer

## Location:

near Boston, MA

## Description:

We're seeking a Junior Software Engineer who's ready to dive into the exciting world of software development. You'll be spinning webs of Java and JavaScript like a caffeinated spider, making legacy systems tremble at your Cloud migration skills, and showing off your knowledge of all things DevSecOps. We need someone who can tickle the underbelly of our existing software, improving performance and functionality until it purrs.

## Primary Responsibilities:

* Design, develop, and test software for Command and Control based products like a culinary genius in a five-star kitchen.
* You'll have your hands in the front end and backend of software prototypes, creating digital masterpieces that speed up our prototyping process. 
* Be our Extreme Programming (XP) evangelist, with practices like pair-programming, test-driven development (TDD), and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) techniques being your daily bread.
* Work in harmony with data scientists, UX designers, engineers, and product managers, creating an ensemble of scalable software solutions.
* Keep an eye on the latest software architectures and trends; think of yourself as our very own tech oracle.
* Help guide our legacy systems into the cloud, like a kindly shepherd leading their flock.

## Required:

* We're not counting years, but we do expect you've had hands-on experience with full-stack software development, and you can speak JavaScript, Java, and maybe even Python, like they're your native languages.
* You've played with DevSecOps tools and processes, and have tamed front end frameworks like React or Vue.
* You've dipped your toes in Extreme Programming practices and contributed to software architecture and design.
* You've unpacked and used container technologies such as Docker or Kubernetes.
* You must be eligible to obtain a minimum of a Secret clearance.

## Desired:

* A degree in a highly quantitative field is always a plus!
* Experience with backend runtimes and frameworks like Node.js, Spring, Spring Boot, Django, Flask, etc. are like icing on the cake.
* You've authored tests in Javascript, Java, or other languages.
* Training, upskilling, and mentoring experience are welcome! Let's grow together!

## Non-Technical Competencies:

* Communication is key; we expect it to be one of your superpowers.
* Maintain a professional and respectful demeanor, because let's face it, nobody likes a grumpy gus.
* Embrace feedback, it's the breakfast of champions!
* Cultivate a can-do attitude. We're not just a team, we're a family.
* Be ready and eager to learn from our more senior engineers; they're wise and have much to teach.

If you're ready to take the red pill and dive into this coding matrix, apply now. We promise it'll be an adventure!
