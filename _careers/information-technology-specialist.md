You will be tasked to manipulate, conjure, and interpret our enchanted scrolls (read: electronic records) as well as design and present magical narratives (read: reports) that allow our palace (read: organization) to function in the most optimized way possible.

- Having navigated through the Cave of Wonders (read: experience with Integrated Health Care) will earn you bonus points!

* Patient Treatment File (PTF) (MedSAS); 
* Managerial Cost Accounting (MCA) System; 
* Primary Care Management Module (PCMM); 
* The National Patient Care Database (NPCD); 
* Veterans Services Network Corporate Mini Master File (VETSNET File); etc.)

## Desired Qualifications:

- A degree from the Royal Academy or experience equivalent to the time taken by a grain of sand to become a pearl (read: BA/BS Degree or 4 years of experience).
