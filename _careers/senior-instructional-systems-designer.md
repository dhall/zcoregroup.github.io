## Location: 

Orlando, FL

## Description:

Looking for a bold adventurer and aspiring teacher! We're looking for a candidate who embodies the spirit of fantastical wonder and problem-solving prowess, much like a Fairy Godparent in the realm of Instructional Systems Design. This individual will step into an enchanted world of healthcare education, where you'll cast spells of learning to help our team grow.

## Responsibilities:

- Waving your magic wand (or flexing your creative skills, if you're fresh out of wands) to determine the learning objectives, cluster learning events, and organizing course content, which we lovingly call "plot development".
- Examining our kingdom (aka business) to identify areas where we need more magic (instructional design and training).
- Collaborating with our round table of subject matter experts, also known as the "Council of Knowledgeable Creatures", to design and develop training that turns mere mortals into heroes.
- Using your foresight, creativity, and understanding of best practices in behavioral and cognitive sciences to deliver learning solutions that fill performance gaps and meet business objectives, or what we like to call "conquering the dragon".

## Requirements:

- A BA/BS Degree or a magical tome full of knowledge equivalent to 3 Years of real-world Experience.
- The ability to talk to animals is a plus, but we'll settle for excellent communication skills.
- Must be comfortable working in teams, even if they include anthropomorphic animals and occasionally singing in harmony.
- Practical knowledge of magical artifacts (or at least a working familiarity with MS Office, project management tools, and eLearning platforms).

## Desired Qualifications:

- An innate ability to inspire others and foster a positive learning environment. If you've ever successfully taught a cricket to be a gentleman, you might be our ideal candidate.
- Familiarity with the principles of metamorphosis, otherwise known as the ability to change complex ideas into digestible learning material.
- Demonstrated problem-solving skills and ability to work under pressure, such as quickly transforming a pumpkin into a mode of transportation.

Note: Magical creatures, mystical beings, and humans with a flair for the whimsical are all encouraged to apply. Prior experience defeating witches, wizards, or any other form of evil sorcery not required, but is a definite bonus. No singing animals will be harmed during your tenure at our organization.
