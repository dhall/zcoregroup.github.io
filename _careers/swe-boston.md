## Location: 

near Boston, MA

## Description:

zCore is looking for a Senior Software Engineer who can write code as compelling as a sonnet and help software teams like a champion. We're after an individual who's adept in automated test procedures, continuous integration and delivery, and improving existing software applications. You'll be juggling multiple hats - from optimizing software designs, keeping up-to-date with the latest software trends, migrating legacy systems to the cloud, strategizing rapid prototyping, to being a mentor to your fellow engineers. Sounds challenging? Don't worry, we have a continuous supply of coffee and cookies (both digital and literal)!

## Primary Responsibilities:

You're a digital maestro, proficient in discussing future limitations and have a forward-thinking approach in resolving roadblocks.
You have a keen interest in latest software architectures and trends from design patterns to DevSecOps and systems architecture patterns.
You’re the go-to person for making technical decisions to migrate legacy systems to the cloud.
You know how to juggle strategies for rapid prototyping of capabilities.
You can analyse, decompose, and convert activities and requirements into software designs.
You've got a knack for capturing, developing, and reporting reference architectures and documenting compliance standards.
You can develop plans, roadmaps, and software design strategies.
You're a pro at implementing and practicing DevOps Enablement.
You’re a mentor at heart, guiding your fellow engineers with troubleshooting techniques, design patterns, and testing strategies.
## Requirements:

You have a Bachelor’s degree in a highly quantitative field (or 3 years of relevant experience that taught you more than any college ever could).
You have professional Full-Stack Software development experience (Java, Web services, Database, and/or web application development).
Your programming skills in JavaScript, Java, and preferably Python are unmatched.
You've got experience with DevSecOps tools and processes such as Git, Concourse, GitLabCI, SonarQube, Fortify, and ThreadFix.
You've worked with front end frameworks like React or Vue.
You're comfortable with Extreme Programming practices.
You've contributed to software architecture and design.
You're not afraid of container technologies such as Docker or Kubernetes.
You’ve had a hand in training, upskilling, and mentoring engineers.
You MUST be eligible to obtain a minimum of a Secret clearance (superhero identity not required).
## Desired Skills:

Master's degree in a highly quantitative field.
Experience with backend runtimes and frameworks like Node.js, Spring, Spring Boot, Django, Flask, etc.
Experience with test authoring in Javascript, Java, or other languages.
Experience with test mocks and contract testing.
Certifications: CompTIA Sec+, CMU SEI - Software Assurance Professional Certificate, or CSSLP.
Active Secret or TS/SCI Clearance.
On the Human Side:

We value communication and soft skills as much as we do code. We're looking for candidates who can uphold respect across the organization.
